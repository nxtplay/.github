## 🚀 **Features**

### **1. AI-Powered Formation Detection**
- **Computer Vision Model**: Leveraged YOLOv8 to detect player formations in football films with a real-time accuracy of **60%**.
- **Robust Detection**: Handles diverse lighting conditions and player occlusions to provide reliable analysis in various scenarios.

### **2. Full-Stack Web Application**
- **Backend**: Built with **Rust/Actix**, ensuring high performance, concurrency, and low latency.
- **Frontend**: Developed a dynamic user interface using **React**, delivering a seamless user experience for video analysis and playback.
- **Database**: Employed **PostgreSQL** for efficient and structured storage of player data, formation metadata, and video analysis results.

### **3. Scalable Infrastructure**
- **Video Streaming**: Integrated **Cloudflare** to provide fast and secure streaming of football films, allowing users to review, label, and analyze formations in real time.
- **API Design**: Designed and documented a robust API to allow for future integrations with third-party applications or additional tooling.

## 🤖 **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Languages**: Rust, JavaScript (React)
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Actix (backend), React (frontend), YOLOv8 (AI/ML model)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare (video streaming, CDN)

---

## 🛠️ **How It Worked**
1. **Video Upload**: Users uploaded football game footage directly to the platform.
2. **AI Analysis**: YOLOv8 analyzed each frame of the video, detecting and labeling player formations.
3. **Interactive Review**: Users could review, adjust, and refine the detected formations using an intuitive web interface.
4. **Insights & Reports**: Custom reports on player movements and team strategies were generated for further analysis.
